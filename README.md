## User Interfaces for Programming Languages: The Compendium

This compendium covers research and practice in the field of 
user interfaces for programming languages, broadly construed. 

### Build Requirements


### Build Instructions

HTML and PDF outputs are generated by
[Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/).

The required libraries are listed in `requirements.txt` and can be installed using `pip` as follows:

```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you can build the HTML output:

```
$ make
```

The result is the `html` directory.

(NOT YET WORKING) Build and publish the result to GitHub pages:

```
$ make publish
```

This uses the [`ghp-import`](https://pypi.org/project/ghp-import/)
tool to push the output to the `gh-pages` branch of this repository,
which is the branch used for publishing to
[https://fplab.github.io/ui-for-pl/](https://fplab.github.io/ui-for-pl/).

### Contributing
Contributions are very welcome through GitHub's pull request mechanism. To quickly propose edits to a single file, you can find it in this repository and click the pencil icon. 

The text for these notes is written in
[reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html),
with the extensions supported by [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/).
This format is similar to Markdown, but offers some more advanced features.
We use BibTeX for citations, via the [sphinxcontrib-bibtex](https://sphinxcontrib-bibtex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) extension.

The notes are structured as one file per topic area in the `src`
directory, with `index.rst` as the top-level organizational hub.

### Contributors

The compendium is maintained by [Cyrus Omar](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~comar) (comar@umich.edu).

The Sphinx setup was adapted from [EECS 490 course notes](https://github.com/eecs490/notes) prepared 
by Amir Kamil (akamil@umich.edu).
