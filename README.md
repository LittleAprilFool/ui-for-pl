User Interfaces for Programming Languages: The Compendium
=========================================================

  > **compendium**. *noun*. a collection of concise but detailed information about a particular subject, especially in a book or other publication.

This compendium covers research and practice in the field of 
user interfaces for programming languages, broadly construed. 

It is structured as an annotated bibliography, organized hierarchically into topic areas, and covering both academic research and notable non-academic designs. In addition to textual summaries, the summaries of notable systems might include screenshots, videos, and links to external resources. The goal in each case is to convey the key results and ideas clearly and concisely, so that the compendium is a useful resource for  researchers, practitioners, and hobbyists who might be interested in **surveying** a topic area.

It will take contributions from many different members of our community to truly achieve a comprehensive compendium covering this diverse field.
The compendium is far from comprehensive today. 
Contributions are very welcome through GitHub's pull request mechanism. 

## Build Requirements

Certain figures in the compendium may require the `pdf2svg` command-line tool to be
installed. On MacOS, it can be installed through Homebrew:

```
$ brew install pdf2svg
```

The remaining required libraries are in `requirements.txt` and can be installed using `pip` as follows:

```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Build Instructions

HTML and PDF outputs are generated by
[Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/).

Build just the HTML output:

```
$ make
```

The result is the `html` directory.

Build both HTML and PDF:

```
$ make all
```

Build and publish the result to GitHub pages:

```
$ make publish
```

This uses the [`ghp-import`](https://pypi.org/project/ghp-import/)
tool to push the output to the `gh-pages` branch of this repository,
which is the branch used for publishing to
[https://fplab.github.io/ui-for-pl/](https://fplab.github.io/ui-for-pl/).

## Contributing

The text for these notes is written in
[reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html),
with the extensions supported by [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/).
This format is similar to Markdown, but offers some more advanced features.

The notes are structured as one file per topic area in the `src`
directory, with `index.rst` as the top-level organizational hub.

## Contributors

The compendium is maintained by [Cyrus Omar](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~comar).

The template for the compendium is based on the EECS 490 course notes prepared 
by Amir Kamil (akamil@umich.edu).
